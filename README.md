# X-ray Denoising
This project is an extension on an existing project made in collaboration with Jan Sijbers. 

## Setup
To setup the project, choose the preffered version. Either conventional flat field correction (FFC) or
dynamic flat field convention (DFFC). This can then again be run in MATLAB or in python. The working
directory is the root of the project ("XrayDenoising"). This project does not need any parameters but do
need a change of where the input and output foders are. The input folder contains all input images needed 
for the algorithm (dark, white, flatfields and the projections).
